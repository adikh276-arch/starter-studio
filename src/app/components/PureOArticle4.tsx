                This is one of the most human and relatable articles on Pure O OCD — written in an accessible, compassionate tone and covering a wide range of subtypes that many people have never heard of. It is particularly valuable for people who are trying to understand whether their own experiences match what Pure O describes.

                The article highlights a crucial reason why Pure O goes undiagnosed for so long: many people spend years or even decades living with undiagnosed OCD because they are unfamiliar with Pure O — since OCD is frequently thought of as a disorder that causes hyper-organized or germaphobia-related behaviors, which is not always the case.

                It also sheds important light on Relationship OCD (ROCD), one of the most commonly misunderstood subtypes of Pure O: ROCD is often misdiagnosed or seen as an underlying attachment disorder in treatment providers who simply don't have a solid grasp of the complexities of OCD and all its variations — with many clinicians mistakenly suggesting the person "may not be right for you" or "should really listen to your doubts," which often leads the ROCD sufferer into a panic.

                The article ends on an empowering note — emphasizing that recovery is fully possible when the right treatment and the right understanding are in place.
