                This is a landmark scientific study that challenges the very foundation of the "Pure O" label — making it one of the most important and thought-provoking articles in the field. It is essential reading for clinicians, researchers, and anyone who wants a deeper, evidence-based understanding of how Pure O actually works.

                {`The study's central finding is groundbreaking: the concept of the "pure obsessional" — patients with unacceptable or taboo thoughts yet no compulsions — may be a misnomer, as these obsessions were factorially associated with mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking in clinical samples, suggesting that what has been called Pure O is not truly free of compulsions at all.`}
              </p>

              <p>
                The study also puts the numbers into perspective: in the DSM-IV field trial, 96% of adults with OCD had both obsessions and compulsions when evaluated by trained raters using the YBOCS-SC, with only 2% having predominantly obsessions — indicating that the pure obsessional type may be far less common than previously suggested.

                This article is a crucial read for anyone wanting to understand why the "Pure O" label, while widely used, remains scientifically controversial.
