                This article is a thorough academic review of all the psychological treatments that have been studied for trichotillomania — making it an invaluable resource for therapists, researchers, and anyone wanting to understand what recovery actually involves.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are six treatments that have been studied for trichotillomania — including habit reversal training (HRT), ACT-enhanced behavior therapy (A-EBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy, comprehensive behavioral treatment (ComB), and metacognitive therapy (MCT) — and of these, acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy has the most empirical support.
              </p>

              <p>
                The article is honest about the current state of research, noting that trichotillomania can be an impactful disorder, yet compared to a multitude of diagnoses, intervention research is notably underdeveloped — particularly for youth, where treatments have limited empirical support.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand exactly which therapies work, for whom, and why — backed by decades of clinical trial data.
