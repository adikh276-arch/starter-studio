                This article is a comprehensive review of the evolving scientific understanding of hoarding — exploring debates around its classification, prevalence, brain differences, and treatment. It is a great read for anyone wanting to understand where the science currently stands and where it is heading.

              <p>
                The article highlights that patients who hoard, compared with other OCD patients, had different functional neuroimaging findings, response to treatment, and clinical profiles — suggesting that the brain of someone with hoarding disorder may actually work differently from that of a person with typical OCD.

              <p>
                On the topic of how widespread hoarding is, the article notes that data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Follow-up survey suggest that 5% of the general population experiences clinically significant hoarding, while data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication indicate that the lifetime prevalence of compulsive hoarding may be as high as 14%.
              </p>

              <p>
                This makes hoarding far more common than most people realize — and yet it remains one of the most under-discussed and under-treated mental health conditions today.
